"""Reconcile scanner observations against the current ``md_change_state``.

Pure function — given a list of :class:`ScanInput` (what's on disk
right now, matched against the kind registry) and the prior state
keyed by ``md_path`` (what's in sqlite), emit the
:class:`ReconcileDecision` set the scanner should UPSERT.

Three categories per 12 doc §5.3:

- **added** — path on disk, no prior state row.
- **modified** — path on disk, prior mtime differs (newer or older;
  cascade does not assume monotonic file timestamps).
- **deleted** — path missing from disk. Emitted unless the prior
  row is *already* the result of a successful delete cycle
  (``status='done' AND change_type='deleted'`` — handler has wiped
  the orphan Postgres rows on a previous sweep). A ``status='done'``
  row whose ``change_type`` is ``'added'`` / ``'modified'`` is still
  emitted: the watcher must have missed the unlink (e.g. fseventsd
  drop, daemon restart window), and we need the scanner to recover
  the deletion or Postgres stays stale.

Paths whose prior state row is ``done`` AND the mtime matches are
skipped on the add/modify side — the reconcile output stays tight on
quiet sweeps.
