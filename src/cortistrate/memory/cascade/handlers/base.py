"""Handler chassis — abstract base + shared :class:`HandlerDeps`.

Each kind has its own concrete handler responsible for translating a
single md path's content (or absence) into the corresponding Postgres
row state. The handler is the *only* cascade-side piece that knows
the per-kind row shape; everything around it (watcher / scanner /
worker / orchestrator / CLI) is kind-agnostic.

Per-kind handlers share the same dependencies bundle — embedding,
tokenizer, memory-root path resolver — packaged as
:class:`HandlerDeps`. Construct it once at orchestrator startup, pass
to every handler factory, no per-row resolution churn.
