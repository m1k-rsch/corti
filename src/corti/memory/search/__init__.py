"""memory.search — read path: hybrid retrieval over Postgres.

This subpackage owns the recall + adapter layer for ``POST
/api/v1/memory/search``. All fusion / rerank / agentic algorithms are
delegated to :mod:`everalgo.rank`; this layer is responsible for:

* compiling the Filters DSL into a Postgres ``where`` string,
* per-kind sparse (BM25 over ``*_tokens``) and dense (vector ANN) recall,
* shape-translating ``everalgo.rank.RankOutput`` into the public DTOs.

Cascade writes drive the underlying Postgres rows; this package never
writes.

    from corti.memory.search import (
        ALLOWED_FIELDS,
        RESERVED_FIELDS,
        FilterError,
        FilterNode,
        SearchAtomicFactItem,
        SearchData,
        SearchEpisodeItem,
        SearchMethod,
        SearchProfileItem,
        SearchRequest,
        SearchResponse,
        compile_filters,
        compile_predicate,
    )

The Filters DSL primitives (``ALLOWED_FIELDS`` / ``RESERVED_FIELDS`` /
``compile_predicate``) are re-exported so :mod:`memory.get` can build
its flat-DSL variant without forking the field allow-list.
