"""AgentSkillWriter — upsert skill main file + reference / script attachments.

Skill storage is **directory + progressive disclosure** (wiki "Memory
Types Markdown Format" v4): each skill lives under
``agents/<agent_id>/skills/skill_<name>/`` with a ``SKILL.md`` main
file plus ``references/*.md`` and ``scripts/*.<ext>`` siblings.

This writer is intentionally distinct from :class:`BaseDailyWriter`:

- **Upsert, not append.** Each ``write_*`` call overwrites the target
  file in full. Skills don't accumulate entry markers — the body of
  ``SKILL.md`` is the latest revision; references / scripts are
  individually replaceable files.
- **Single-skill API.** The chassis is *not* responsible for bulk
  enumeration (Tier-1 prompt scanning is a sqlite/postgres concern,
  not a markdown-walk concern). One skill in, one skill out.
- **No counters / hooks.** No frontmatter merging, no entry-id
  generation, no _frontmatter_updates hook — the caller hands in a
  fully-built :class:`AgentSkillFrontmatter` subclass instance and the body
  string; the writer atomically replaces the file.

Path resolution comes from :class:`MemoryRoot` + the ClassVars on
:class:`AgentSkillFrontmatter` (``SKILLS_CONTAINER_NAME`` /
``SKILL_DIR_PREFIX`` / etc.). The writer + reader pair is the single
addressing API for skills.
