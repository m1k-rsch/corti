"""Domain layer: the business core.

Defines memory-domain models and implements write / read / sync /
prompt management capabilities.

External usage:
    from corti.memory import (
        CanonicalMessage, IngestResult, PipelineOutcome,
        ToolCall, MemCell, Episode, AlgoMessage,
    )

Path resolution and addressing of markdown records live with the infra
writer/reader pair (``BaseDailyWriter`` / ``BaseDailyReader`` /
``SkillWriter`` / ``SkillReader`` / ``ProfileWriter`` /
``ProfileReader``) — see :mod:`corti.infra.persistence.markdown`. The
domain layer here is reserved for actual business logic (extract /
cascade / search / prompt_slots / evolution).
